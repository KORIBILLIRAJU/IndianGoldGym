<p>In Indian gold gym is highly trained persons are there</P>

<p>*It’s good for your health

We’re stating the obvious with this one but did you know that being active daily reduces the risk of heart disease, strokes and type 2 diabetes?</p>

<p>It’s good for your mind

When you exercise, endorphins are released which can calm anxiety and lift your mood.</p>

<p>It’s a great stress buster

Had a busy day? There is nothing more rewarding then running further or lifting heavier than you have before. Plus, the fitter you get, the better your body is at regulating cortisol levels (the hormone linked to stress).
Access to equipment

Being a member of a gym means you have access to tons of equipment, allowing you to keep your routine fresh and exciting.</p>

<p>Access to knowledge

If you’re a workout newbie, a gym membership can give you the tools and knowledge to start out. Learn the ropes by booking on the induction programme, attending classes or even get a Personal Trainer.
It keeps you motivated

Going to the gym and being surrounded by motivated people can encourage you to stay on track. Plus, having somewhere to go sounds more appealing then working out in the park or in your living room.</p>

<p>You get an all-weather workout

Ever binned off a run because it was raining? Ditched the outdoor bootcamp because it was dark? The gym offers a great place to work out whatever the weather and time of year, so no excuses!</p>

<p>Meet like-minded people

Joining a gym can be quite social. If you’re a regular at classes, then you begin to get to know people and before you know it you’re lifelong friends.
It will improve your sleep

Studies show that people who exercise 5 to 6 times a week are more likely to get a good night’s kip.</p>

<p>You can have somewhere to relax

Generally, people join a gym to workout but they are actually a great place to unwind. A gentle swim or sit in the sauna for some ‘me time’ will have you zen before you know it.</p>
